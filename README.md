## Jamie's CMake Training Course

### Prerequisites

#### Knowledge
At least CS103 or equivalent experience with C++ code is recommended to be able to complete the session exercises.  However, if you don't have this experience, you're welcome to attend and listen to the lecture or work with someone else on the exercises.

#### Computer
You will need access to a proper command line environment with a C++ compiler and CMake installed.  The easiest way to get this is to use the CS104 course virtual machine, or (if you have a Mac) install cmake and g++ via Homebrew.  If you use Windows then WSL is a good option, you can install it using [Microsoft's guide here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10).  Please setup the environment a couple days in advance to leave time for any issues, and message Jamie if you have any trouble.

It's also highly recommended to install CMake syntax highlighting for your favorite text editor.  For Sublime Text I recommend the `CMake` package. 

Note: MinGW on Windows can work but requires you to change the file extensions in the commands I give so is for advanced users only.

#### Repository
Clone the repository `https://github.com/multiplemonomials/CMakeTraining` to a folder on your computer to get access to the powerpoints and the files needed for the exercises.
